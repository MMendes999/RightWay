#Following the tutorials from the book "Node.js the Right Way" by Jim R. Wilson

>I will be following the tutorials/examples from the book and correct when I find some errors (because there are some).

>__I will only be posting the code and some notes that I might find relevant to the reader.__

>The point of this repo is not to copy the book, but to keep track of the tutorials written in the book and also to assist any readers who might encounter any doubts in the code presented in the book that might not seem clear at first because at times code is divided in on or two pages, or substitutes pieces of code with another and if you do not pay close attention to these details your code will not work and you will get weird outputs.
