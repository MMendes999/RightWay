//So far we have written code with the assumption that all messages are passed whole.
//However this is no always true, in fact, it is a best case scenario. In the "wild" more often than not,
//messages are passed in chunks and are received split into one or more parts. This is known as the Message-Boundry Problem.
//The LDJ (Line-Delimited JSON - defined on page 30) protcol corrects this by setting message boundries. It does this by //seperating messages with
//newline characters. Each newline character (\n) is the boundry between two messages.
//This test differs from the previous 'net-watcher-json-service' by instead of setting up a file-system (fs) watcher,
//here we just return the first PREDETERMINED chunk immediately.
