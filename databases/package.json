//This is an example package file that describes aspects of the projects and its dependencies. This particular example
//includes: the project's name, version, short description, and author.
//for your projects, rather than create a package.json file by hand, you can use 'npm init'. This will
//prompt you for all the important information

{
	"name": "book-tools",

}


//When you install a module through npm, you have the choice of saving it as a dependency in the 'package.json'.
//You do this with the --save flag. Run the following command from your project directory:

//npm install --save request

//This will install the request module and record it as a dependency in your 'package.json'. If you take a look at 
//your 'package.json' file again, you'll see that there's now a dependencies section that looks like this:

/*
	"dependecies" : {
		"request" : ~2.26.0"
	}
*/

//When you describe your dependecies in a package.json file, npm can install them all for you.
//This is most useful when distribuiting your module, or when collaborators work on the same code base.
//To install all of the dependecies for the current project, just run npm intall with no additional arguments .
